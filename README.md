# 🚀 Welcome to the Expo React Native Project

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created using [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app). It uses **file-based routing** via [`expo-router`](https://expo.github.io/router/docs).

## 🛠️ Project Setup for Collaborators

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/blckzr/SmartShield.git
cd SmartShield
```

> 📁 Make sure you're inside the project root directory before continuing.

---

### 2. Install Node JS

```bash
https://nodejs.org/en
```

- Visit the website and install the appropriate version for your device.
- Install the Node JS by opening the wizard.
- Install all default settings.

### 3. Install Dependencies

Run this after cloning the project or pulling changes that update dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

If you're using Yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```

---

### 4. Start the App

```bash
npm start
```

This will launch the Expo Developer Tools in your browser. From there, you can:

- Run the app in **Expo Go** (scan the QR code)
- Open it in an **Android emulator**
- Launch it in an **iOS simulator** (macOS only)
- Open the project in a **web browser**

---

## 📂 Project Structure

- `app/` – All screen files and routes (uses file-based routing)
- `components/` – Shared and reusable UI components
- `assets/` – Images, icons, fonts, etc.
- `package.json` – Project dependencies and scripts

---

This moves the current `app/` directory to `app-example/` and creates a blank `app/` folder.

---

## 📦 Adding New Packages

If you install new packages, make sure to:

1. Commit both `package.json` and `package-lock.json`
2. Inform your team to run `npm install` after pulling

---

## 🔐 Environment Variables

If you're using a `.env` file:

- **Do NOT commit it to Git**
- Share it securely with teammates
- Provide a `.env.example` with required variables
